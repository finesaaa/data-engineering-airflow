# Data Engineering using Airflow

## 🗃️ Project Overview: Fetch and Store Youtube Data API

This project aims to set up a daily workflow using Apache Airflow to retrieve trending videos data from the YouTube Data API v3 and store it in MySQL. 

### Key Features:
- **Data Retrieval:** Fetches trending videos data from the YouTube Data API v3.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocesses the fetched data to extract relevant information.
- **Data Storage:** Stores the preprocessed data in MySQL for further analysis and usage.
- **Automation:** Set up DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Apache Airflow to automate the data retrieval and storage process.

### Technologies Used:
- **Apache Airflow:** Workflow management system for orchestrating data pipelines.
- **YouTube Data API v3:** API for accessing and retrieving YouTube data.
- **Python:** Programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
- **SQLite:** Relational database management system for storing the retrieved data.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress with the development and deployment of this data pipeline!
