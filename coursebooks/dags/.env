# You we need to create a new project in Google Cloud Platform. First go to the Google Cloud Console, then click on the project dropdown menu and select New Project. 
# We will name the project as airflow-youtube-project and click Create. Wait a few moment until the project is sucessfully created. 
# Note that the project ID may be different from the project name.
# Once the project is created, select the project from the dropdown menu and go to the APIs & Services Dashboard. 
# Click on Enable APIs and Services, then search for Youtube Data API v3 and enable them. By default, the BigQuery API should already be enabled (in case it is not, please enable it as well). After enabling the Youtube Data API v3, click on the Credentials tab. Click on the Create Credentials and select API key. 
# Copy the API key and save it in a .env file in the airflow_youtube_project/dags directory. We will use this API key later to fetch data from YouTube.
